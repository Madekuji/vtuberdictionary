  definition: Shorthand for "anti-fan" and Japanese English translation for "hater,"
    from the Japanese wasei-eigo アンチ (anchi). In terms of VTubers, antis are people
    who focus on hating either a specific VTuber or group, or VTuber culture as a
    whole. Can also be used in other fandoms or cultures.
  example1: As fans, we ought to defend and protect against antis who'd do nothing
    but harass.
  example2: It's honestly interesting to take a look at the thought process of an
    anti.
  example3: It's one thing to be an anti, but totally another to be an anti doing
    illegal stuff.
