  definition: Translates to "would like anyone" or "I love anyone." This is an idol/wota
    term that denotes a person being a fan who can like anyone in a certain group,
    as opposed to only one person. In the VTuber landscape, a daredemo daisuki is
    someone who may have one or two favorite VTubers but is completely open to and
    may regularly watch others as opposed to sticking to exclusively one or two. Can
    be abbreviated as "DD."
  example1: Hard for me to make time for anything since I'm kind of a <i>daredemo
    daisuki</i>.
  example2: "<i>Daredemo daisukis</i> are insane, especially those that can watch
    multiple streams at once."
  example3: I love VTubers and VTuber culture as a whole, and that probably explains
    why I'm a <i>daredemo daisuki</i>.
