  definition: Can be translated as "precious" or "wholesome." It's meant to describe
    precious or wholesome moments, which are usually interactions between two or more
    VTubers. This originated from another word, 尊い (toutoi). This variation may have
    started from a Nijisanji fan comic back in 2018. Can also be used as ていてい (teitei),
    tee-tee, or tete.
