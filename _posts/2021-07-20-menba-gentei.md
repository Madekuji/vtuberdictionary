  definition: Translated as "members-only," signifying content exclusive to the VTuber's
    paid members. YouTube has a paid membership system for eligible YouTube channels
    that allows access to certain perks and content unavailable to public viewers;
    such content is classified as "members-only." This includes members-only messages,
    emotes, videos, streams, and other content. Commonly shortened as メン限 (mengen).
    Can also be spelled as memba gentei, menbaa gentei, or menbā gentei.
  example1: Kanata said that she's doing a "menba gentei stream," I believe that means
    she'll do a members-only stream.
